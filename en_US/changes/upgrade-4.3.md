# Upgrade from 4.2 to 4.3

Due to database schema and inter-broker API changes, a EMQ X 4.3 node can not
join a 4.2 cluster.
The recommended way to upgrade is be done in below high-level steps

1. Export database from one of the 4.2 nodes (see below for db export command)
1. Create a standing-by 4.3 cluster using 4.3 configurations
1. Import database to one of the 4.3 nodes and restart the cluster
1. Cut traffic from 4.2 cluster over to 4.3 cluster
1. Shutdown the 4.2 cluster

To provision the new cluster, old data stored in the builtin database (Mnesia)
can be migrated with the data export and import tool command.
There are also a few incmpatible configuration changes.

## Database migration

`emqx_auth_mnesia` plugin now supports rules based on both `clientid` and `username`.
Previously only one type of filter was supported, as configured in `etc/plugins/emqx_auth_mnesia.conf` file.
In order to import data from the previous EMQ X versions, it is necessary to specify the value of this parameter by passing it as a CLI option:

```bash
$ emqx_ctl data import <filename> --env '{"auth.mnesia.as":"username"}'
```

or

```bash
$ emqx_ctl data import <filename> --env '{"auth.mnesia.as":"clientid"}'
```

Or by editing the import file using the same format.

## Important config changes

- EMQ X now tries to use tlsv1.3 by default, please make sure openssl is up to date (1.1.1), otherwise SSL related configs such as `listener.ssl.external.tls_versions` may have to be changed to remove tls1.3 from the list.
- New configs `listener.ws.$zone.check_origin_enable` `listener.ws.$zone.allow_origin_absence` and `listener.ws.$zone.check_origins` for better websocket securty.
- Config `listener.ws.$name.verify_protocol_header` is replaced by `listener.ws.external.fail_if_no_subprotocol` and `listener.ws.external.supported_subprotocols`
- Config node.heartbeat can not be overriden from environment variable `EMQX_NODE__HEARTBEAT` [#5929](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/issues/5929)
- log.formatter=json to log in JSON format, but it may requre more CPU resources.
- log.single_line=true to collect logs in one line.
- Config `rpc.tcp_client_num` now defaults to 1. A value greater than 1 may cause messages out of order when sent between the nodes in a cluster.

### Important plugin config changes

- `emqx_auth_http` plugin config changes.
  To make it easier to understand, we use the key word REQUEST for `auth_req`，`super_req` and `acl_req`.
  - The config key `auth.http.REQUEST` is replaced by `auth.http.REQUEST.url`.
  - Config key `auth.http.header.<Key>` is replaced by `auth.http.REQUEST.headers.<Key> = <Value>`. i.e. it is now possible to configure different HTTP headers per REQUEST type.
  - Config key `auth.http.REQUEST.content_type` is replaced by `auth.http.REQUEST.headers.content_type`.
  - Config key `auth.http.request.timeout` is replaced by `auth.http.timeout`.
  - Config key `auth.http.request.connect_timeout` is replaced by `auth.http.connect_timeout`.
  - The retry config keys `auth.http.request.retry_times`，`auth.http.request.retry_interval` and `auth.http.request.retry_backoff` are deleted.
  - New config `auth.http.pool_size` to support configurable pool size.
  - New config `auth.http.enable_pipelining` to enable HTTP Pipelining.
  - New security related configs: `auth.http.ssl.verify` and `auth.http.ssl.server_name_indication`.

- `emqx_auth_mongo`:
  - Config key `auth.mongo.login` is renamed to `auth.mongo.username`
  - Config keys `auth.mongo.ssl_opts.*` are replaced by ` auth.mongo.ssl.*`

- `emqx_auth_pgsql`:
  - Config keys `auth.mongo.ssl_opts.*` are replaced by ` auth.mongo.ssl.*`

- `emqx_auth_redis`:
  - SSL configs are now groupped by `.ssl` in the config path. e.g. `auth.redis.cacertfile` is now `auth.redis.ssl.cacertfile`

- `emqx_web_hook` config changes (Note: webhook resources and actions in rule engine is migrated by the database migration command)
  - Config key `web.hook.api.url` is renamed to `web.hook.url`.
  - Config key `web.hook.encode_payload` is replaced by `web.hook.body.encoding_of_payload_field`
  - New security config `web.hook.ssl.verify` and `web.hook.ssl.server_name_indication`
  - New configs: `web.hook.pool_size` `web.hook.enable_pipelining` 配置项，允许配置进程池大小和是否启用 HTTP Pipelining。

## Important behaviour changes

- Logs timestamps is now RFC3339 format, make sure your log indexer is ready for this change.
- When `round_robin` strategy is used for shared subscribe, the dispatch now starts from a random member in the group (instead of always starting from the first).
- When rule engin starts up, unavailable resources are automatically retried.
- New MacOS package no longer supports the version older than 10.14.
- The underlying transport protocol for `emqx_exhook` plugin (which supports developing plugins in other languages) has been changed from erlport to gRPC,
  meaning it will not able to communicate with extension plugins develped for 4.2.
